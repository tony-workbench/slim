# SLiM: One-shot Quantized Sparse Plus Low-rank Approximation of LLMs

This repository contains the implementation of SLiM (Sparse Low-rank Approximation with Quantization), a novel 
compression technique for large language models (LLMs). SLiM combines a one-shot quantization and sparse low-rank 
approximation to reduce memory usage and improve inference speed without requiring retraining. The approach features 
SLIM-Quant, a symmetric quantization method, and a saliency-based low-rank approximation that leverages sparsity 
patterns like 2:4 for optimized performance on accelerated hardware. With this, SLiM offers state-of-the-art accuracy 
while maintaining efficiency in memory-constrained environments.

## Setup

The list of requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. To install the requirements, run the following command:

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start
Our code base supports multiple pruning, quantization, and low-rank approximation techniques. Below, we provide an 
example and a brief description of how to use our code base. For a more automated and detailed example, please refer to
[srcipts/run.sh](scripts/run.sh).

Also, an interactive Google Colab notebook is available at [SLiM Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10ysTtwiFvyMYZooNqZK2g8kz3mN55309?usp=sharing).

**Model and Tokenizer Instantiation:** Our code base supports models from HuggingFace's transformers library. In this example, we use
the OPT-125M model from [facebook/opt-125m](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-125m). Please note that we load the model in CPU to reduce memory overheads 
on GPUs. Our code supports single-GPU compression of very large models, as long as a single transformer block of the 
model fits in the GPU memory.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch


model_name = "facebook/opt-125m"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    )

model.eval()

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    use_fast=False,
)
```

**Compression:** We provide a function `prune_and_quantize` that takes in a model, tokenizer, and depending on the 
input arguments prunes, quantizes, and add low-rank approximation to the model. Below, we provide an example of how to 
use it for SLiM Low-rank approximation and SLiM-Quant quantization method. More details about the `prune_and_quantize`
function are provided in the **Function Documentation** section.

```python
from slim.prune import prune_and_quantize

quantize_lora_flag = True
lora_tile_size = 256
quantization_bitwidth = 4

prune_and_quantize(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    prune_method="wanda",
    sparsity_ratio=0.5,
    quantize_weight=False,
    bitwidth=quantization_bitwidth,
    slim_quant=True,
    lora_rank=0.1,
    sparsity_type="2:4",
    weight_tiled_quantization=quantize_lora_flag,
    quantize_lora=lora_tile_size,
)
```

**Optional Fine-tuning:** After compression, the model can be fine-tuned to compensate for the accuracy loss using the
`fine_tune` function provided in our code base. When using low-rank adapters, the `fine_tune` function will 
automatically freeze the original weights and biases and only fine-tunes the low-rank adapters. Otherwise, the original
weights and biases will be fine-tuned and requantized in the end if needed. Below, we provide an example of how to use
the `fine_tune` function. More details about the `fine_tune` function are provided in the **Function Documentation** section.

```python
from slim.fine_tune import fine_tune

fine_tune(
    model,
    tokenizer,
    max_train_samples=30000,
    optimizer="adafactor",
    global_batch_size=64,
    local_batch_size=8,
)
```

**Adapter Quantization:** In case the `quantize_lora` is set to `True` in the `prune_and_quantize` function, the low-rank
will be prepared for quantization. To finalize the adapter quantization, you can use the `quantize_lora` function.

```python
from slim.lora import quantize_lora

if quantize_lora_flag:
    quantize_lora(
        model,
        bitwidth=quantization_bitwidth,
        lora_tile_size=lora_tile_size,
    )
```

**Input Quantization:** You can emulate input group quantization using the `attach_input_quantization_hooks` function. 
This function attaches hooks to the linear layers of the model to quantize the input activations. We use FP8 quantization with a single parameter when `bitwidth=8` and integer group quantization for other values of `bitwidth`. `input_goup_size=-1` uses per-token quantizatoin.

```python
from slim.quantization.quantization import attach_input_quantization_hooks

attach_input_quantization_hooks(
    model,
    bitwidth=8,
    input_group_size=128, #Only when bitwidth!=8
)
```

**Check Sparsity Ratio:** You can check the sparsity ratio of the model using the `check_sparsity` function.

```python
from slim.utils import check_sparsity

check_sparsity(model)
```

**Save Checkpoint:** You can save the compressed model (with the quantization metadata) using `save_model` function. The pruning, quantization, and low-rank adapter arguments will be stored with the model as well for future reference.

```python
from slim.save_model import save_model

save_model(model, args.save_checkpoint_path, args)
```

**Evaluate Perplexity:** You can evaluate the perplexity of the model using the `eval_ppl` function.

```python
from slim.eval import eval_ppl

ppl_test = eval_ppl(
    model,
    tokenizer,
    eval_dataset="wikitext2",
    eval_batch_size=8,
)

print(f"WikiText2 Perplexity: {ppl_test:.2f}")
```

**Zero-shot Task Evaluation:** For running the zero-shot task evaluation on the model, and a more automated example of
using the code base, please refer to the [scripts/run.sh](scripts/run.sh) file. You can run it by executing the 
following command.

```bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```

**Note:** If your cluster does not have internet access, you can download the models and datasets using the `scripts/download_data.sh` script.


## Model Loading and Acceleration

You can load the compressed checkpoints using the `load_compressed_model` function. This function does adds the corresponding low-rank hooks (if used) and prepares the model for accelerated inference. The model compressoin configuration is already saved in the checkpoint using the `save_model` function.

```python
from slim.load_model_with_acceleration import load_compressed_model

model, tokenizer, args, lora_hooks = load_compressed_model("path/to/model")
```

For loading the model with acceleration using [Sparse Marlin](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Sparse-Marlin) backend, you can use `load_and_accelerate_model` function. This function will load the model and prepare it for accelerated inference using Sparse Marlin.

```python
from slim.load_model_with_acceleration import load_and_accelerate_model

model, tokenizer = load_and_accelerate_model("path/to/model")
```

For an example of using both of the above functions, you can refer to `slim/load_model_with_acceleration.py` file, which evaluated the perplexity of the loaded model on WikiText2 dataset.

## Experimental Results

We provide extensive experimental results in the paper. For completeness, we have provided the average accuracy results 
of sparse and quantized models on a range of zero-shot tasks using different pruning and quantization methods in the 
table below. The weights (and possibly the adapter) are quantize to 4 bits using symmetric quantization, and the inputs 
are quantized using 8-bit group quantization. All the group quantization results use a group size of 128.

For additional per-task results, please refer to our [Weights & Biases report](https://wandb.ai/mohammad-mozaffari-university-of-toronto/SLiM/reports/SLiM-One-shot-Quantization-and-Sparsity-with-Low-rank-Approximation-for-LLM-Weight-Compression--VmlldzoxMzk2OTY4Ng?accessToken=52z9njwmbnzn2eidqla2ic0p36lyeeyu0zirbwj7nwoljpd9km55ytl95a6b5p3p).

**Notes:**
- *Best Method* refers to the best quantization method among Group AbsMax, AWQ, OmniQuant, and AffineQuant.
- "OOM" indicates an out-of-memory error.
- **Bold values** indicate the best performance in each section.

## Speedup Experiments

We support both layer-wise and end-to-end model speedup evaluation. 

### Layer-wise Speedup

For layer-wise
speedup experiments, please refer to `speedup/layerwise_speedup.py`. You can set the 
`quanti_only` flag to `True` to only evaluate the quantization speedup. If set to `False`,
both sparsity and quantization speedup will be evaluated. We use [Sparse Marlin](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Sparse-Marlin)
integrated in [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) in our code. The following 
figures show the SLiM's speedup with FP16 and INT4 low-rank adapters on NVIDIA RTX-3060 and
A100 GPUs. The bright part shows the contribution of the quantization to the total speedup.

<img src="./assets/a100_speedup.svg" alt="A100 Speedup" width="600">

## Memory Reduction Experiments

You can evaluate the memory reduction of SLiM using `scripts/model_memory_reduction.sh`. This script will call `speeudp/model_memory_reduction.py`, which loads and evaluates the memory usage of dense and compressed models. SLiM with quantized low-rank adapters achieves 0.23x memory reduction for LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B on NVIDIA A100-40GB GPUs.
